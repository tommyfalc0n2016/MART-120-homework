Learning styles are very interesting and a helpful tool when figuring out what works most comfortably for you. My learning styles according to the quiz was tactile and visual. This makes sense for the most part because I tend to jump onto projects before knowing exactly what it is because I feel like just doing it will make me learn it. I also see that arbitrary point of view on the concept of learning styles because there can be so many different ways someone can obtain a certain type of lesson or lecture. I think it is more appropriate to examine what types of content needs what type of learning style. If it is a desk I bought from Ikea I will probably use my tactile learning style to examine each piece so I know what it feels like when I'm building. But for a lecture I will be doing my best to listen and take notes so I can examine them later. I think it is helpful to have these learning styles but I don't think one is better than the other.
