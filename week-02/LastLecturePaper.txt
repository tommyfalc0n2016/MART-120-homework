Randy Pausch’s outlook on life is very inspirational and allows for a broad outlook on goals and what kind of journey it can be. It was a shock to hear his condition and life expectancy. With this in mind while watching the lecture, it made me look at the importance of my life and the life I've been living. I was also able to look at my dreams as a kid and that made me feel very happy for my younger self because I am working toward those dreams but also in those things that I didn't achieve, like the lecture said,  there is experience when you don't get the thing you wanted. Those words are very helpful to hear, especially in a school setting, students can easily beat themselves up because of this goal they are trying to achieve semester after semester. Randy had a special thing that he conveyed in this lecture and that was that he was able to find tools and ways to fix his problems. Like a puzzle almost, he had an outlook that made the issue also the solution. The concept of a brick wall being there to show us how badly we want something is also a very nice sentiment that is attractive when looking at my own goals. There are things that we run into in life that feel like there is no other option than to quit, but in those moments where you overcome that and find a way through that wall, I feel like that's when you know you really care about something. Some other key takeaways from this lecture that I feel are helpful are “When you see yourself doing badly, and no one is there to tell you so, that's a bad place to be”. Being in a creative field, it is the most important thing to me to have that criticism. I wouldn't have learned nearly as much as I did if I didn't have someone to help and give constructive criticism. The other thing that was really interesting to me was the Head Fake concept. To learn something and not even know your learning is a really cool thing to think about in regard to our daily lives and how we interact with people and our work.
